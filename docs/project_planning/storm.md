Abstract

We study how to apply large language models
to write grounded and organized long-form ar-
ticles from scratch, with comparable breadth
and depth to Wikipedia pages. This underex-
plored problem poses new challenges at the
pre-writing stage, including how to research
the topic and prepare an outline prior to writ-
ing. We propose STORM, a writing system
for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through
Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Ask-
ing. STORM models the pre-writing stage by
(1) discovering diverse perspectives in research-
ing the given topic, (2) simulating conversa-
tions where writers carrying different perspec-
tives pose questions to a topic expert grounded
on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the col-
lected information to create an outline.

For evaluation, we curate FreshWiki, a dataset
of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and
formulate outline assessments to evaluate the
pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback
from experienced Wikipedia editors. Com-
pared to articles generated by an outline-
driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of
STORM’s articles are deemed to be organized
(by a 25% absolute increase) and broad in cov-
erage (by 10%). The expert feedback also
helps identify new challenges for generating
grounded long articles, such as source bias
transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.

Figure 1: We explore writing Wikipedia-like articles
from scratch, which demands a pre-writing stage before
producing the article. In this stage, simpler approaches
like Direct Prompting have limited planning capacity. In
contrast, STORM researches the topic via perspective-
guided question asking in simulated conversations.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive writing capabilities (Yang et al., 2023;
Pavlik, 2023; Wenzlaff and Spaeth, 2022; Fitria,
2023), but it is unclear how we can use them to
write grounded, long-form articles, like full-length
Wikipedia pages. Such expository writing, which
seeks to inform the reader on a topic in an or-
ganized manner (Weaver III and Kintsch, 1991;
Balepur et al., 2023), requires thorough research
and planning in the pre-writing stage (Rohman,

1965), even before the actual writing process can
start. However, prior work on generating Wikipedia
articles (Banerjee and Mitra, 2015; Minguillón
et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Fan and Gardent,
2022) has generally bypassed the pre-writing stage:
for instance, Liu et al. (2018) presume reference
documents are provided in advance, while Fan and
Gardent (2022) assume an article outline is avail-
able and focus on expanding each section. These
assumptions do not hold in general, as collecting
references and crafting outlines demand advanced
information literacy skills (Doyle, 1994) to iden-

tify, evaluate, and organize external sources - a task
that is challenging even for experienced writers.
Automating this process can facilitate individuals
in initiating in-depth learning about a topic and
greatly reduce the expensive expert hours neces-
sary for their expository writing.

We explore these challenges by focusing on how
to generate Wikipedia-like articles from scratch.
We decompose this problem into two tasks. The
first is to conduct research to generate an outline,
i.e., a list of multi-level sections, and collect a set of
reference documents. The second uses the outline
and the references to produce the full-length arti-
cle. Such a task decomposition mirrors the human
writing process which usually includes phases of
pre-writing, drafting, and revising (Rohman, 1965;
Munoz-Luna, 2015).

As pre-trained language models inherently pos-
sess a wealth of knowledge, a direct approach is to
rely on their parametric knowledge for generating
outlines or even entire articles (Direct Gen). How-
ever, this approach is limited by a lack of details
and hallucinations (Xu et al., 2023), particularly in
addressing long-tail topics (Kandpal et al., 2023).
This underscores the importance of leveraging ex-
ternal sources, and current strategies often involve
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which cir-
cles back to the problem of researching the topic in
the pre-writing stage, as much information cannot
be surfaced through simple topic searches.

Human learning theories (Tawfik et al., 2020;
Booth et al., 2003) highlight asking effective
questions in information acquisition. Although
instruction-tuned models (Ouyang et al., 2022) can
be prompted directly to generate questions, we find
that they typically produce basic “What”, “When”,
and “Where” questions (Figure 1 (A)) which often
only address surface-level facts about the topic. To
endow LLMs with the capacity to conduct better
research, we propose the STORM paradigm for
the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval
and Multi-perspective Question Asking.

The design of STORM is based on two hypothe-
ses: (1) diverse perspectives lead to varied ques-
tions; (2) formulating in-depth questions requires
iterative research. Building upon these hypotheses,
STORM employs a novel multi-stage approach. It
first discovers diverse perspectives by retrieving
and analyzing Wikipedia articles from similar top-
ics and then personifies the LLM with specific per-
spectives for question asking (Figure 1 (B)). Next,
to elicit follow-up questions for iterative research

(Figure 1 (C)), STORM simulates multi-turn con-
versations where the answers to the generated ques-
tions are grounded on the Internet. Finally, based
on the LLM’s internal knowledge and the collected
information, STORM creates an outline that can
be expanded section by section to develop a full-
length Wikipedia-like article.

We evaluate STORM using our FreshWiki
dataset (§2.1) which curates recent, high-quality
Wikipedia articles to avoid data leakage during pre-
training.1 To facilitate the study of the pre-writing
stage, we define metrics for evaluating the outline
quality against human-written articles.

We further invited a group of experienced
Wikipedia editors for expert evaluation. The ed-
itors found STORM outperforms an outline-driven
RAG baseline, especially regarding the breadth and
organization of the articles. They also identified
challenges for future research, including address-
ing cases where: (1) the bias on the Internet affects
the generated articles; (2) LLMs fabricate connec-
tions between unrelated facts. These challenges
present new frontiers to grounded writing systems.

Our main contributions include:

• To evaluate the capacity of LLM systems at
generating long-form grounded articles from
scratch, and the pre-writing challenge in par-
ticular, we curate the FreshWiki dataset and
establish evaluation criteria for both outline
and final article quality.

• We propose STORM, a novel system that au-
tomates the pre-writing stage. STORM re-
searches the topic and creates an outline by
using LLMs to ask incisive questions and re-
trieving trusted information from the Internet.

• Both automatic and human evaluation demon-
strate the effectiveness of our approach. Ex-
pert feedback further reveals new challenges
in generating grounded long-form articles.

ing sub-tasks of gathering and curating relevant

usually contain structured data (e.g., tables) and are

ponent in constructing the dataset to simplify our
task. More details of the dataset are in Appendix A.

writing approach which has prompted some educa-
tors to view Wikipedia article writing as an educa-
tional exercise for academic training (Tardy, 2010).
Table 1 compares our work against prior bench-
marks for Wikipedia generation. Existing work
has generally focused on evaluating the generation
of shorter snippets (e.g., one paragraph), within a
narrower scope (e.g., a specific domain or two), or
when an explicit outline or reference documents
are supplied. A notable example is WikiSum (Liu
et al., 2018), which treats generating Wikipedia ar-
ticles as a multi-document summarization problem,
with respect to the reference documents.

Our setup emphasizes the capability of long-
form grounded writing systems to research and
curate content. Specifically, given a topic t, the
task is to find a set of references R and generate
a full-length article S = s1s2...sn, where each
sentence si cites a list of documents in R.2

2.1 The FreshWiki Dataset

Creating a new Wikipedia-like article demands not
only fluent writing but also good research skills. As
modern LLMs are generally trained on Wikipedia
text, we mitigate data leakage by explicitly seeking
out recent Wikipedia articles that were created (or
very heavily edited) after the training cutoff of the
LLMs we test. Our process can be repeated at
future dates when new LLMs emerge.

To apply our date criteria, we focus on the top
100 most-edited pages, based on edit counts, for
each month from February 2022 to September
20233. To ensure high-quality references, we filter
these articles to keep only those having B-class
quality or above assessed by ORES4. We also ex-

as section and subsection titles, which do not require citations.

2.2 Outline Creation and Evaluation

A full-length article is hard to generate or evalu-
ate (Xu et al., 2023; Krishna et al., 2023). When
human educators teach students academic writing,
they sometimes supervise students at the outline
stage (Eriksson and Mäkitalo, 2015) because an
extensive outline indicates a comprehensive under-
standing of the topic and provides a solid founda-
tion for writing the full-length article (Dietz and
Foley, 2019). Inspired by this, we decompose the
generation of S into two stages. In the pre-writing
stage, we require the system to create an outline
O, which is defined as a list of multi-level section
headings6. In the writing stage, the system uses
the topic t, the references R, and an outline O to
produce the full-length article S.

To evaluate the outline coverage, we introduce
two metrics: heading soft recall and heading en-
tity recall. These metrics compare the multi-level
section headings of the human-written article, con-
sidered as ground truth, and those in O. Recog-
nizing that an exact match between elements in
these two sets of headings is unnecessary, we cal-
culate the heading soft recall (Fränti and Mariescu-
Istodor, 2023) using cosine similarity derived from
Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) em-
beddings of the headings (details in Appendix C.1).
We also compute the heading entity recall which
is quantified as the percentage of named entities in
human-written article headings covered by O. We
extract entities with FLAIR named entity recogni-
tion (NER) (Akbik et al., 2019).

3 Method

We present STORM to automate the pre-writing
stage by researching a given topic via effective
question asking (§3.1, §3.2) and creating an out-
line (§3.3). The outline will be extended to a full-
length article grounded on the collected references

5https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:

Stand-alone_lists

6Since language models process and produce sequences,
we can linearize O by adding “#” to indicate section titles,
“##” to indicate subsection titles, etc.

Figure 2: The overview of STORM that automates the pre-writing stage. Starting with a given topic, STORM
identifies various perspectives on covering the topic by surveying related Wikipedia articles ( 1 - 2 ). It then
simulates conversations between a Wikipedia writer who asks questions guided by the given perspective and an
expert grounded on trustworthy online sources ( 3 - 6 ). The final outline is curated based on the LLM’s intrinsic
knowledge and the gathered conversations from different perspectives ( 7 - 8 ).

(§3.4). Figure 2 gives an overview of STORM and
we include the pseudo code in Appendix B.

3.1 Perspective-Guided Question Asking

Rohman (1965) defines pre-writing as the stage
of discovery in the writing process.
In parallel
with stakeholder theory in business (Freeman et al.,
2010), where diverse stakeholders prioritize vary-
ing facets of a company, individuals with distinct
perspectives may concentrate on different aspects
when researching the same topic and discover mul-
tifaceted information. Further, the specific perspec-
tives can serve as prior knowledge, guiding individ-
uals to ask more in-depth questions. For example,
an event planner might ask about the “transporta-
tion arrangements” and “budget” for “the 2022
Winter Olympics opening ceremony”, whereas a
layperson might ask more general questions about
the event’s basic information (Figure 1 (A)).

Given the input topic t, STORM discovers differ-
ent perspectives by surveying existing articles from
similar topics and uses these perspectives to control
the question asking process. Specifically, STORM
prompts an LLM to generate a list of related top-
ics and subsequently extracts the tables of contents
from their corresponding Wikipedia articles, if such
articles can be obtained through Wikipedia API7
(Figure 2 1 ). These tables of contents are con-
catenated to create a context to prompt the LLM
to identify N perspectives P = {p1, ..., pN } that

7https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/

can collectively contribute to a comprehensive ar-
ticle on t (Figure 2 2 ). To ensure that the basic
information about t is also covered, we add p0 as
“basic fact writer focusing on broadly covering the
basic facts about the topic” into P. Each perspec-
tive p ∈ P will be utilized to guide the LLM in the
process of question asking in parallel.

3.2 Simulating Conversations

The theory of questions and question asking (Ram,
1991) highlights that while answers to existing
questions contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of a topic, they often simultane-
ously give rise to new questions. To kick off this
dynamic process, STORM simulates a conversa-
tion between a Wikipedia writer and a topic ex-
In the i-th round of the conversation, the
pert.
LLM-powered Wikipedia writer generates a sin-
gle question qi based on the topic t, its assigned
perspective p ∈ P, and the conversation history
{q1, a1, ..., qi−1, ai−1} where aj denotes the sim-
ulated expert’s answer. The conversation history
enables the LLM to update its understanding of the
topic and ask follow-up questions. In practice, we
limit the conversation to at most M rounds.

To ensure that the conversation history provides
factual information, we use trusted sources from
the Internet to ground the answer ai to each query
qi. Since qi can be complicated, we first prompt
the LLM to break down qi into a set of search
queries (Figure 2 4 ) and the searched results will
be evaluated using a rule-based filter according to

sources (Figure 2 5 ). Finally, the LLM synthe-
sizes the trustworthy sources to generate the answer
ai, and these sources will also be added to R for
full article generation (§3.4).

3.3 Creating the Article Outline

After thoroughly researching the topic through
N + 1 simulated conversations, denoted as
{C0, C1, ..., CN }, STORM creates an outline before
the actual writing starts. To fully leverage the inter-
nal knowledge of LLMs, we first prompt the model
to generate a draft outline OD given only the topic
t (Figure 2 7 ). OD typically provides a general
but organized framework. Subsequently, the LLM
is prompted with the topic t, the draft outline OD,
and the simulated conversations {C0, C1, ..., CN }
to refine the outline (Figure 2 8 ). This results
in an improved outline O which will be used for
producing the full-length article.

3.4 Writing the Full-Length Article

Building upon the references R collected and the
outline O developed during the pre-writing stage,
the full-length article can be composed section by
section. Since it is usually impossible to fit the
entire R within the context window of the LLM,
we use the section title and headings of its all-level
subsections to retrieve relevant documents from
R based on semantic similarity calculated from
Sentence-BERT embeddings. With the relevant in-
formation at hand, the LLM is then prompted to
generate the section with citations. Once all sec-
tions are generated, they are concatenated to form
the full-length article. Since the sections are gen-
erated in parallel, we prompt the LLM with the
concatenated article to delete repeated information
to improve coherence. Furthermore, in alignment
with Wikipedia’s stylistic norms, the LLM is also
utilized to synthesize a summary of the entire arti-
cle, forming the lead section at the beginning.

4 Experiments

4.1 Article Selection

randomly select 100 samples from the FreshWiki
dataset (see §2.1) that have human-written articles
not exceeding 3000 words.

4.2 Automatic Metrics

As discussed in §2.2, we evaluate the outline qual-
ity to assess the pre-writing stage by calculating
the heading soft recall and heading entity recall. A
higher recall score signifies a more comprehensive
outline relative to the human-written article.

To assess the full-length article quality, we adopt
ROUGE scores (Lin, 2004) and compute the entity
recall in the article level based on FLAIR NER
results. Moreover, based on Wikipedia criteria9,
we evaluate the article from the aspects of (1) In-
terest Level, (2) Coherence and Organization, (3)
Relevance and Focus, (4) Coverage, and (5) Verifia-
bility. For aspects (1)-(4), we use Prometheus (Kim
et al., 2023), a 13B evaluator LLM to score the arti-
cle based on a 5-point rubric collaboratively devel-
oped with two experienced Wikipedia editors (see
Appendix C.2). For verifiability, we calculate the
citation recall and citation precision based on the
definition in Gao et al. (2023). We use Mistral 7B-
Instruct (Jiang et al., 2023a) to examine whether
the cited passages entail the generated sentence.

4.3 Baselines

As prior works use different setups and do not use
LLMs, they are hard to compare directly. Instead,
we use the following three LLM-based baselines.

1. Direct Gen, a baseline that directly prompts
the LLM to generate an outline, which is then
used to generate the full-length article.

2. RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation base-
line that searches with the topic and uses the
searched results together with the topic t to
generate an outline or the entire article.

3. Outline-driven RAG (oRAG), which is iden-
tical to RAG in outline creation, but further
searches additional information with section
titles to generate the article section by section.

STORM is capable of researching complicated top-
ics and writing long articles from detailed outlines.
However, in this controlled experiment, we limit
the final output to at most 4000 tokens (roughly
3000 words). For a meaningful comparison, we

in STORM are both set as 5. We use the chat
model gpt-3.5-turbo for question asking and
use gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct for other parts of
STORM. We also experiment with using gpt-4 for
drafting and refining the outline (Figure 2 7 - 8 ).
For reported results, the simulated topic expert in
STORM is grounded on the You.com search API10,
although the proposed pipeline is compatible with
other search engines. The ground truth Wikipedia
article is excluded from the search results.

For final article generation, we only report the
results using gpt-4 as gpt-3.5 is not faithful to
sources when generating text with citations (Gao
et al., 2023). We set temperature as 1.0 and top_p
as 0.9 for all experiments.

5 Results and Analysis

5.1 Main Results

We use outline coverage as a proxy to assess the pre-
writing stage (see §2.2). Table 3 shows the heading
soft recall and entity recall. Outlines directly gen-
erated by LLMs (Direct Gen) already demonstrate

10https://documentation.you.com/api-reference/

search

high heading soft recall, indicating LLMs’ ability
to grasp high-level aspects of a topic through their
rich parametric knowledge. However, STORM, by
asking effective questions to research the topic, can
create higher recall outlines that cover more topic-
specific aspects. Notably, although RAG leverages
additional information, presenting unorganized in-
formation in the context window makes outline
generation more challenging for the weaker model,
i.e., GPT-3.5, leading to worse performance. To test
the limit of the RAG baseline, we further expand
the retrieved sources by starting with the outline
produced by RAG, using its section titles as search
queries to collect more sources, and inputting the
newly collected sources together with the initial
outline to LLM to generate a polished outline. This
modified approach is referred to as “RAG-expand”
in Table 3. The experiment results indicate that
even though having an additional round of search
and refinement can improve the outline produced
by RAG, our proposed STORM still surpasses its
performance.

We further evaluate the full-length article quality.
As shown in Table 2, oRAG significantly outper-
forms RAG, highlighting the effectiveness of using
outlines for structuring full-length article genera-
tion. Despite this method’s advantages in leverag-
ing retrieval and outlining, our approach still out-
performs it. The effective question asking mecha-
nism enhances the articles with greater entity recall.
The evaluator LLM also rates these articles with sig-
nificantly higher scores in the aspects of “Interest
Level”, “Relevance and Focus”, and “Coverage”.
Nonetheless, we acknowledge the possibility of
the evaluator LLM overrating machine-generated
text. Our careful human evaluation (§6) reveals
that STORM still has much room for improvement.

Although this work primarily focuses on the pre-
writing stage and does not optimize generating text
with citations, we still examine the citation quality
of articles produced by our approach. As reported

pendix C.3 investigates the unsupported sentences
and reveals that the primary issues stem from draw-
ing improper inferences and inaccurate paraphras-
ing, rather than hallucinating non-existent contents.

5.2 Ablation Studies

As introduced in §3, STORM prompts LLMs to
ask effective questions by discovering specific
perspectives and simulating multi-turn conversa-
tions. We conduct the ablation study on outline
creation by comparing STORM with two variants:
(1) “STORM w/o Perspective”, which omits per-
spective in the question generation prompt; (2)
“STORM w/o Conversation”, which prompts LLMs
to generate a set number of questions altogether. To
ensure a fair comparison, we control an equal total
number of generated questions across all variants.
Table 3 shows the ablation results and full STORM
pipeline produces outlines with the highest recall.
Also, “STORM w/o Conversation” gives much
worse results, indicating reading relevant informa-
tion is crucial to generating effective questions. We
further examine how many unique sources are col-
lected in R via different variants. As shown in Ta-
ble 5, the full pipeline discovers more different
sources and the trend is in accord with the auto-
matic metrics for outline quality.

We also verify whether having an outline stage
is necessary with STORM. In Table 2, “STORM
w/o Outline Stage” denotes the results of generat-
ing the entire article given the topic and the sim-
ulated conversations. Removing the outline stage
significantly deteriorates the performance across
all metrics.

6 Human Evaluation

To better understand the strengths and weaknesses
of STORM, we conduct human evaluation by col-
laborating with 10 experienced Wikipedia editors

generated by STORM and oRAG. Each pair of articles

indicating good quality (see Table 10). We conduct
paired t-test and report the p-value.

who have made at least 500 edits on Wikipedia and
have more than 1 year of experience. We randomly
sample 20 topics from our dataset and evaluate the
articles generated by our method and oRAG, the
best baseline according to the automatic evaluation.
Each pair of articles is assigned to 2 editors.

We request editors to judge each article from the
same five aspects defined in §4.2, but using a 1 to
7 scale for more fine-grained evaluation. While
our automatic evaluation uses citation quality as
a proxy to evaluate Verifiability, we stick to the
Wikipedia standard of “verifiable with no original
research” in human evaluation. Besides rating the
articles, editors are asked to provide open-ended
feedback and pairwise preference. After the evalua-
tion finishes, they are further requested to compare
an article produced by our method, which they have
just reviewed, with its human-written counterpart,
and report their perceived usefulness of STORM
using a 1-5 Likert scale. More human evaluation de-
tails are included in Appendix D. Table 6 presents
the rating and pairwise comparison results.11
Articles produced by STORM exhibit greater
breadth and depth than oRAG outputs. In ac-
cord with the finding in §5.1, editors judge articles
produced by STORM as more interesting, orga-
nized, and having broader coverage compared to
oRAG outputs. Specifically, 25% more articles pro-
duced by STORM are considered organized (Orga-
nization rating ≥ 4), and 10% more are deemed to
have good coverage (Coverage rating ≥ 4). Even
in comparison with human-written articles, one
editor praises our result as providing “a bit more

11For the 1-7 scale rating results on each criterion, we cal-
culate the Krippendorff’s Alpha to measure the inter annotator
agreement (IAA), and the results are as follows: Interest Level
(0.349), Organization (0.221), Relevance (0.256), Coverage
(0.346), Verifiability (0.388).

for a new topic. More reservation is expressed to
the usefulness of STORM for the Wikipedia com-
munity at large; nonetheless, 70% of the editors
think it is useful, with only 10% disagreeing.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Aug-
menting language models (LMs) with retrieval at
inference time is a typical way to leverage exter-
nal knowledge stores (Ram et al., 2023; Izacard
et al., 2023). While some works use retrieval
to construct demonstrations for in-context learn-
ing (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022; Agrawal et al.,
2023; Poesia et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022; Khattab
et al., 2022), another line of works uses retrieval to
provide additional information for LMs to ground
on. Lewis et al. (2020) study RAG on knowledge-
intensive NLP tasks and find it improves diver-
sity and factuality. Semnani et al. (2023) de-
signs a RAG-based chatbot grounded on English
Wikipedia to stop LLM-based chatbots from hal-
lucination. Besides, RAG can be used to generate
text with citations (Menick et al., 2022; Gao et al.,
2023) and build attributed question answering sys-
tems (Bohnet et al., 2023). While RAG is widely
studied in question answering, how to use it for
long-form article generation is less investigated.

As a general framework, RAG is flexible in both
the retrieval source and time. The retrieval sources
can vary from domain databases (Zakka et al.,
2023), code documentation (Zhou et al., 2023),
to the whole Internet (Nakano et al., 2022; Komeili
et al., 2022). Regarding the time, besides a one-
time retrieval before generation, the system can be
designed to self-decide when to retrieve across the
course of the generation (Jiang et al., 2023b; Parisi
et al., 2022; Shuster et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023).
Automatic Expository Writing Different from
other types of long-form generation (Yang et al.,
2022; Feng et al., 2018), automatic expository writ-
ing requires grounding on external documents and
leveraging the interplay between reading and writ-
ing. Balepur et al. (2023) propose the Imitate-
Retrieve-Paraphrase framework for expository writ-
ing at the paragraph level to address the challenges
in synthesizing information from multiple sources.
Beyond summarizing sources, Shen et al. (2023)
highlight that expository writing requires the au-
thor’s sensemaking process over source documents
and good outline planning. We tackle these chal-
lenges by focusing on the pre-writing stage.

background information” and another notes that “I
found that the AI articles had more depth compared
to the Wikipedia articles”. STORM also outper-
forms the best baseline in pairwise comparison.
More information in |R| poses challenges be-
yond factual hallucination. We examine 14 pair-
wise comparison responses where editors prefer
oRAG outputs over STORM. Excluding 3 cases
where pairwise preferences do not align with their
ratings, editors assign lower Verifiability scores to
articles from our approach in over 50% of the cases.
Through analyzing the articles and editors’ free-
form feedback, we discover that low Verifiability
scores stem from red herring fallacy or overspec-
ulation issues. These arise when the generated
articles introduce unverifiable connections between
different pieces of information in |R| or between
the information and the topic (examples included
in Table 11). Compared to the widely discussed
factual hallucination (Shuster et al., 2021; Huang
et al., 2023), addressing such verifiability issues is
more nuanced, surpassing basic fact-checking (Min
et al., 2023).
Generated articles trail behind well-revised hu-
man works. While STORM outperforms the
oRAG baseline, editors comment that the generated
articles are less informative than actual Wikipedia
pages. Another major issue identified is the trans-
fer of bias and tone from Internet sources to the
generated article, with 7 out of 10 editors men-
tioning that the STORM-generated articles sound
“emotional” or “unneutral”. More analysis is dis-
cussed in Appendix E. This feedback suggests that
reducing the retrieval bias in the pre-writing stage
is a worthwhile direction for future work.
Generated articles are a good starting point. As
shown in Figure 3, editors are unanimous in agree-
ing that STORM can aid them in their pre-writing
stage. It is gratifying to know that the tool is help-
ful to experienced editors. 80% of the editors think
that STORM can help them edit a Wikipedia article

bilities in NLP systems have expanded across sev-
eral fronts, including generating clarification ques-
tions to understand user intents (Aliannejadi et al.,
2019; Rahmani et al., 2023), and breaking large
questions into smaller ones to improve composi-
tional reasoning (Press et al., 2023). While humans
usually ask questions to learn new knowledge (Taw-
fik et al., 2020; Booth et al., 2003), how to opti-
mize question informativeness and specificity in
information-seeking conversations remains less ex-
plored. The closest work is Qi et al. (2020) which
defines the question informativeness using the un-
igram precision function and uses reinforcement
learning to increase the question informativeness.

8 Conclusion

We propose STORM, an LLM-based writing sys-
tem that automates the pre-writing stage for creat-
ing Wikipedia-like articles from scratch. We cu-
rate the FreshWiki dataset and establish evaluation
criteria to study the generation of grounded long-
form articles. Experimental results demonstrate
that the question asking mechanism in STORM
improves both the outline and article quality. With
the improved breadth and depth, STORM helps
surface new challenges for grounded writing sys-
tems through expert evaluation. The experienced
Wikipedia editors in our study unanimously agree
that STORM is helpful for their pre-writing stage.

Limitations

In this work, we explore generating Wikipedia-
like articles from scratch as a way to push the
frontier of automatic expository writing and long-
form article generation. While our approach sig-
nificantly outperforms baseline methods in both
automatic and human evaluations, the quality of
machine-written articles still lags behind well-
revised human-authored articles, specifically in
aspects of neutrality and verifiability. Although
STORM discovers different perspectives in re-
searching the given topic, the collected information
may still be biased towards dominant sources on
the Internet and may contain promotional content.
Moreover, the verifiability issues identified in this
work go beyond factual hallucination, which high-
lights new challenges to grounded writing systems.
Another limitation of this work is that although
we focus on the task of generating Wikipedia-like
articles from scratch, our task setup is still simpli-

fied to only consider the generation of free-form
text. Human-authored high-quality Wikipedia ar-
ticles usually contain structured data and multi-
modal information. We leave the exploration of
generating multi-modal grounded articles for fu-
ture work.

Ethics Statement

Different from the creative generation, grounded ar-
ticle generation may impact how people learn about
topics or consume source information. All the stud-
ies and the evaluation in this work are designed
to prevent the dissemination of misinformation by
not publishing generated content online and im-
plementing strict accuracy checks. We avoid any
disruption to Wikipedia or related communities, as
our system does not interact with live pages. Also,
although we try to generate grounded articles, we
believe there is no privacy issue related to this work
as we only use information publicly available on
the Internet.

the
The primary risk of our work is that
Wikipedia articles written by our system are
grounded on information on the Internet which
contains some biased or discriminative content on
its own. Currently, our system relies on the search
engine to retrieve information but does not include
any post-processing module. We believe improv-
ing the retrieval module to have good coverage of
different viewpoints and adding a content sifting
module to the current system will be a critical next
step to achieve better neutrality and balance in the
generated articles.

Another limitation we see from an ethical point
of view is that we only consider writing English
Wikipedia articles in this work. Extending the cur-
rent system to a multilingual setup is a meaningful
direction for future work as more topics do not have
Wikipedia pages in non-English languages.

B Pseudo Code of STORM

In §3, we introduce STORM, a framework that au-
tomates the pre-writing stage by discovering differ-
ent perspectives, simulating information-seeking
conversations, and creating a comprehensive out-
line. Algorithm 1 displays the skeleton of STORM.
We implement STORM with zero-shot prompt-
ing using the DSPy framework (Khattab et al.,
2023). Listing 1 and 2 show the prompts used
in our implementation. We highlight that STORM
offers a general framework designed to assist the
creation of grounded, long-form articles, without
depending extensively on prompt engineering for a
single domain.

C Automatic Evaluation Details

C.1 Soft Heading Recall

We calculate the soft heading recall between the
multi-level headings in the generated outline, con-
sidered as the prediction P , and those in the human-
written article, considered as the ground truth G.
The calculation is based on the soft recall defini-
tion in Fränti and Mariescu-Istodor (2023). Given
a set A = {Ai}K
i=1, soft count of an item is defined
as the inverse of the sum of its similarity to other
items in the set:

count (Ai) =

1
j=1 Sim (Ai, Aj)

(cid:80)K

(1)

Sim (Ai, Aj) = cos (embed(Ai), embed(Aj)) ,

where embed(·) in Equation (1) is parameterized
by paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 provided in the
Sentence-Transformers library13. The cardinality

article editing process.

A Dataset Details

As discussed in §2.1, we curate the FreshWiki
dataset by collecting recent and high-quality En-
glish Wikipedia articles. We select the most-edited
pages over a specific period rather than using cre-
ation dates as a cutoff because most of Wikipedia
articles are “stubs” or are of low quality when they
were created. For quality, we consider articles pre-
dicted to be of B-class quality or above. According
to Wikipedia statistics12, only around 3% of ex-
isting Wikipedia pages meet this quality standard.
As LLMs can generate reasonably good outputs,
we think it is important to use high-quality human-
written articles as references for further research.

For experiments in this work, we randomly se-
lect 100 samples with human-written articles un-
der 3000 words to have a meaningful comparison.
Table 7 gives the data statistics. Notably, human-
authored articles have a large number of references
but they require numerous edits to achieve this. Fig-
ure 4 illustrates the evolution of the reference count
in the article edit process and Figure 5 gives the dis-
tribution of edit counts for human-authored articles
used in our experiments.

C.2 LLM Evaluator
We use Prometheus14 (Kim et al., 2023), a 13B
open-source evaluator LLM that can assess long-
form text based on customized 1-5 scale rubric, to
grade the article from the aspects of Interest level,
Coherence and Organization, Relevance and Fo-
cus, and Coverage. Table 8 gives our grading rubric.
While Prometheus is best used with a score 5 ref-
erence answer, we find adding the reference will
exceed the context length limit of the model. Since
Kim et al. (2023) show Prometheus ratings without
reference also correlate well with human prefer-
ences, we omit the reference and trim the input
article to be within 2000 words by iteratively re-
moving contents from the shortest section to ensure
the input can fit into the model’s context window.

Table 9: Examples of different error types of unsupported sentences.

We use Mistral 7B-Instruct15 (Jiang et al., 2023a)
to examine whether the cited passages entail the
generated sentence. Table 4 reports the citation
quality of articles produced by our approach, show-
ing that around 15% sentences in generated articles
are unsupported by citations. We further investi-
gate the failure cases by randomly sampling 10
articles and an author manually examines all the
unsupported sentences in these articles. Besides
sentences that are incorrectly split16, lack citations,
or are deemed supported by the author’s judgment,
our analysis identifies three main error categories
(examples are given in Table 9): improper inferen-
tial linking, inaccurate paraphrasing, and citing
irrelevant sources.

We show the error distribution in Figure 6. No-
tably, the most common errors stem from the ten-
dency of LLMs to form improper inferential links
between different pieces of information presented
in the context window. Our analysis of citation
quality suggests that, in addition to avoiding hallu-
cinations, future research in grounded text gener-
ation should also focus on preventing LLMs from
making overly inferential leaps based on the pro-
vided information.

D Human Evaluation Details

We recruited 10 experienced Wikipedia editors
to participate in our study by creating a research
page on Meta-Wiki17 and reaching out to active
editors who have recently approved articles for
Wikipedia.18 Our participation group includes 3
editors with 1-5 years of experience, 4 with 6-10
years, and 3 with over 15 years of contribution.
The study was approved by the Institutional Re-
view Board of our institution and the participants
signed the consent form through Qualtrics ques-
tionnaires before the study started.

To streamline the evaluation of grounded articles,
we developed a web application, which features a
side-by-side display of the article and its citation
snippets, to gather ratings and open-ended feedback

15https://huggingface.co/mistralai/

Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1

for each article. Figure 7 shows the screenshot of
our web application and the full article produced
by STORM is included in Table 12. For human
evaluation, we use a 1 to 7 scale for more fine-
grained evaluation. The grading rubric is included
in Table 10.

We collected the pairwise preferences and the
perceived usefulness of STORM via an online ques-
tionnaire. Specifically, for the perceived usefulness,
we request editors to rate their agreement with state-
ments “I think it can be specifically helpful for my
pre-writing stage (e.g., collecting relevant sources,
outlining, drafting).”, “I think it will help me edit
a Wikipedia article for a new topic”, “I think it
can be a potentially useful tool for the Wikipedia
community” on a Likert scale of 1-5, correspond-
ing to Strongly disagree, Somewhat disagree, Nei-
ther agree nor disagree, Somewhat agree, Strongly
agree.

E Error Analysis

While articles produced by STORM are preferred
by both automatic metrics and human evaluation,
experienced editors still identified multiple prob-
lems with the machine-generated articles. We an-
alyze the free-form comments and summarize the
major issues in Table 11.

The primary issue raised is that the generated
articles often contain emotional language and lack
neutrality, primarily due to the source material.
STORM currently retrieves grounding sources
from the Internet which is not neutral and con-
tains considerable promotional content on its own.
Addressing this bias in the pre-writing stage repre-
sents a valuable direction for future research. An-
other major issue is the red herring fallacy or the
over-association of unrelated facts. Addressing this
challenge calls for high-level sensemaking rather
than mere fact-level verification.

16Following Gao et al. (2023), we check citation quality in
the sentence level and split articles into sentences using NLTK
sent_tokenize. sent_tokenize sometimes fails to split sen-
tences correctly when the article contains special words like
“No.12847”, “Bhatia et al.”, etc.

Taylor Hawkins

Oliver Taylor Hawkins (1972-2022) was an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock

band Foo Fighters[1]. Born in Fort Walton, Texas, Hawkins’ love for music was ignited at a young age,

particularly after watching a Queen concert in 1982[2][3][5]. He kick-started his professional career

as the drummer for Alanis Morissette’s band during her world tour for the hit album ’Jagged Little

Pill’[8][9]. His talents were recognized by Dave Grohl, who invited him to join the Foo Fighters in

1997, marking the beginning of his impactful tenure with the band[7][8].

Hawkins was celebrated for his versatile drumming style, drawing influence from renowned drummers like

Roger Taylor, Neil Peart, Phil Collins, Alex Van Halen, and Stewart Copeland[14]. His performances,

marked by a unique energy and aggressive style of play, earned him recognition as one of the top rock

drummers of his era[15]. Apart from his role in the Foo Fighters, Hawkins’ passion for music saw

him involved in numerous side projects and collaborations, cementing his place in the world of rock

music[10].

Outside of his professional life, Hawkins was known for his resilience and dedication to his family.

Despite personal struggles, including a near-fatal drug overdose in 2001, Hawkins remained committed to

his musical career[4][9]. His legacy continues to inspire musicians and fans alike, as his contributions

to rock music, coupled with his indomitable spirit, made him an unforgettable icon in the music

industry[13].

Hawkins’ sudden death in 2022 while on tour in Bogotá, Colombia, sent shockwaves through the music

world[34]. Tributes poured in from around the globe, reflecting the respect and admiration Hawkins

had garnered during his lifetime[21][31]. His life and career were honored at a star-studded tribute

concert in Los Angeles, attesting to the enduring impact of his music[22].

# Early Life and Background

Oliver Taylor Hawkins, known as Taylor Hawkins, was born and raised in Fort Walton, Texas[3]. His

family moved to Laguna Beach, California when he was four years old[3]. He has two younger siblings,

a brother named Jason, and a sister named Heather[3]. As a child, Hawkins was particularly influenced

by his paternal grandmother, Josie Hawkins, who had grown up during the Great Depression and lived in

Jackson, Mississippi[1].

During his high school days at Laguna Beach High School, from where he graduated in 1990, he became

friends with Jon Davison, who later became the lead vocalist of the band Yes[2][3]. His interest in

music was nurtured from an early age, particularly after watching a Queen concert in 1982 which inspired

him to learn to play the drums[2][5]. He noted that music was a constant presence in his family home[5].

Despite facing certain hardships during his upbringing, including his mother’s struggles with "demons",

Hawkins pursued his musical ambitions[4]. He credits his older sister Heather for taking care of the

family during difficult times[4].

His first major musical experience came from playing drums for Alanis Morissette’s album, Jagged Little

Pill, and accompanying her on the subsequent tour[3]. This marked the beginning of his professional

career in the music industry.

# Career

Taylor Hawkins began his professional music career playing in Alanis Morissette’s band during her

18-month world tour in support of the hit album ’Jagged Little Pill’ from 1995 to 1997[8][9]. His

performances not only in the tour but also in the music videos for “You Oughta Know”, “All I Really Want”

and “You Learn” introduced him to the world of rock music and ultimately led to his meeting with Dave

Grohl[8]. Throughout this time, Hawkins contributed significantly to the band’s sound and performance,

transforming the songs from their original drum loop format to a rock-band vibe that resonated with

audiences[1][7].

In 1997, Hawkins was asked by Grohl to join the Foo Fighters, an invitation that he readily accepted[7][8].

At the time, Grohl thought it was a long shot to recruit Hawkins given that Morissette was at the height

of her career, but Hawkins’ desire to be a part of a rock band compelled him to make the move[7]. This

marked the beginning of Hawkins’ tenure as the drummer of the Foo Fighters, a role that he would play

until his passing[6][9].

Apart from his work with Morissette and the Foo Fighters, Hawkins had an array of other musical

experiences[10]. He drummed for Sass Jordan before joining Morissette’s touring band[10]. He was part

of an ad hoc drum supergroup called SOS Allstars and filled the void for Coheed and Cambria’s 2007

album after their drummer Josh Eppard left the group[10]. In addition, Hawkins formed his own side

project, the Coattail Riders, in 2005, through which he recorded his own music and took the project on

the road, performing in small clubs despite the Foo Fighters’ arena-status[7]. His son, Shane Hawkins,

has since taken on his father’s legacy, joining the Foo Fighters for a performance during the Boston

Calling Music Festival in 2023[6].
